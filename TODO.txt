Convert one of the sprites into a keyboard-controlled tank.
    Hold brake (down) to slow to a stop.
    Release brake after stopping and press it again to go into reverse,
    Reverse is half speed.

Design levels and player interactions (e.g. place doors and switches)

Camera follows player's vehicle.

Finish this TODO list so we know how much is left to do

Convert other sprites into stationary obstacles (bushes, walls, boulders)

Use Rabbyt collision detection to see whether the player is colliding with
anything. See advice at:
http://groups.google.com/group/rabbyt/browse_frm/thread/9da3abc732599b76

Add collision response, to stop the player driving through obstacles

Add a countdown timer
When timer reaches zero, player's position is reset to start

Add a 'player echo', which replays the player's movements

Start point is some sort of funky 'exit from the time machine' special effect

Add a 'goal portal' : any player image colliding with this successfully
completes the game

Add force fields.

Add pressure switches. Sitting on one disables a forcefield.

Several pressure switches may be required to deactivate a single forcefield.

Create the level.

Goal portal only appears after completing all tasks in the level.

Nine lives exactly.

Display remaining lives on the HUD

Game over after using ninth life

display the entry portal (start location for all lives) as a special effect.
A scramble of chrono-static, obviously.

Player emerges from entry portal at full speed, and coasts to a stop if no
controls are pressed.

Get Harry to record some voiceover announcements
    Welcome
    Chronotank
    Game Over

Display congrats and score when game is completed 

Score one for each item of progress towards the goal.
(e.g. for each door opened, each threshold passed.)

Display the score.

Sound effects:
    Engine noise.
    Engine revs higher/faster as you accelerate.
    Chronostatic as you emerge from the entry portal
    'clang' on fast collision with a rock.
    point being scored

Animate the tank treads

Brake lights come on when you brake.

Reverse lights come on when you reverse.

Leave tracks behind as you drive.

Spurt out particle effect fountain of dirt behind you when accellerating.


Optional things to consider
---------------------------

Should player have a control to shortcut the countdown timer and move straight
on to next 'life'? If so, and it is triggered, then the current player image
does not just evaporate, but continues to sit in its current position until
the end of game time (i.e. when the countdown timer would have expired.)

Should player be able to shoot the gun? To what end?


Done
====

Get some sprites onscreen, rendered by Rabbyt

Add camera which can scroll around (to follow the player.) Also, as bonus,
it can rotate or zoom in or out - not sure we'll use this. Maybe for
special effect 'camera shake' on crashes
