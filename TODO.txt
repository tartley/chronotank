Convert one of the sprites into a keyboard-controlled vehicle

Camera follows player's vehicle.

Convert other sprites into stationary obstacles (bushes, walls, boulders)

Use Rabbyt collision detection to see whethre the player is colliding with anything

Add collision response, to stop the player driving through obstacles

Add a countdown timer
When timer reaches zero, player's position is reset to start

Add a 'player echo', which replays the player's movements

Start point is some sort of funky 'exit from the time machine' special effect

Add a 'goal portal' : any player image colliding with this successfully completes the game

Display congrats and score when game is completed 

Finish this TODO list so we know how much is left to do

Design levels and player interactions (e.g. place doors and switches)


Done
====

Get some sprites onscreen, rendered by Rabbyt
Add camera which can scroll around (to follow the player.) Also, as bonus,
it can rotate or zoom in or out - not sure we'll use this except maybe for
special effect 'camera shake' on explosions, crashes?
