Design levels and player interactions (e.g. place doors and switches)

Camera follows player's vehicle.

Sound effects:
    Engine noises - revs higher/faster as you accelerate.
    Chronostatic as you emerge from the entry portal
    'clang' on fast collision with rocks and walls
    pleasant flourish for point being scored
    Slight squeak for brakes being applied

More SVG required:
    * Boulders and rocky outcrops (circular collision boundaries, or collection
      of several circles)
    * Mayan ruins: buildings and walls, which will form axis-aligned rectangular
      obstacles to define rooms, etc.
    * Stone pressure pads in the ground which the tank will drive on to
      activate. (With 'normal' and 'depressed' appearance)
    * Entry portal - flashy special effect which player emerges from. This will
      hang around continuisly, so needs to be long-running cycling animation
    * Goal portal - some variation on the entry portal (we could just do
      this in code using the same SVG, adding color tints or different
      animation params)
    
Convert SVG into bitmaps, stationary obstacles (bushes, walls, boulders)

Render items in layers:
    0 weeds, flowers - things your tank drives over.
    1 tank images (previous player tanks.)
    2 current tank
    3 trees / bushes - things player drives under.
    4 hud

Use Rabbyt collision detection to see whether the player is colliding with
anything. See advice at:
http://groups.google.com/group/rabbyt/browse_frm/thread/9da3abc732599b76

Add collision response, to stop the player driving through obstacles

test py2exe

test py2app

test cx_freeze

Add a countdown timer
When timer reaches zero, player's position is reset to start

Add a 'player echo', which replays the player's movements
One new echo for each countdown

Nine lives exactly.

Start point is some sort of funky 'exit from the time machine' special effect

Add a 'goal portal' gameitem: any player image colliding with this successfully
completes the game

Add force fields.

Add pressure switches. Sitting on one disables a forcefield.

Populate the word to create the layout of the level at game start.
    - do we load levels from disk? Can we make an in-game level editor?

Several pressure switches may be required to deactivate a single forcefield.

Goal portal only appears after completing all tasks in the level.

Display remaining lives on the HUD

Game over after using ninth life

display the entry portal (start location for all lives) as a special effect.
A scramble of chrono-static, obviously.

Player emerges from entry portal at full speed, and coasts to a stop if no
controls are pressed.

Get Harry to record some voiceover announcements
    Welcome
    Chronotank
    Game Over
    5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

Display congrats and score when game is completed 

Score one for each item of progress towards the goal.
(e.g. for each door opened, each threshold passed.)

Display the score.

modify tank handling to allow for slight skids
Release brake after stopping and press it again to go into reverse,
Reverse is half speed.

Animate the tank treads

Brake lights come on when you brake.

Reverse lights come on when you reverse.

Leave tracks behind as you drive.

Spurt out particle effect fountain of dirt behind you when accellerating.


Optional things to consider
---------------------------

Should player have a control to shortcut the countdown timer and move straight
on to next 'life'? If so, and it is triggered, then the current player image
does not just evaporate, but continues to sit in its current position until
the end of game time (i.e. when the countdown timer would have expired.)

Should player be able to shoot the gun? To what end?


Done
====

Get some sprites onscreen, rendered by Rabbyt

Add camera which can scroll around (to follow the player.) Also, as bonus,
it can rotate or zoom in or out - not sure we'll use this. Maybe for
special effect 'camera shake' on crashes

convert cars into bushes, weeds, flowers

Add a single tank

Tank can be driven with keyboard
    accel to accel
    left and right to rotate
    forward motion in direction tank is facing
    cursors or WASD
    brake to rapidly slow to a stop
